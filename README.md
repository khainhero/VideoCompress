# goals of this fork

To make iOS and Android more campitable in terms of compression of video.

For example: Making sure the quality presets have the same output in terms of aspect ratio and resolution.

Make sure videos compressed on iOS can be played without error on Android and vice versa

Ultimate goal is to find the balance of encoding speed, output file size and optimal output video quality.

# video_compress

Compress videos, remove audio, manipulate thumbnails, and make your video compatible with all platforms through this lightweight and efficient library.
100% native code was used, we do not use FFMPEG as it is very slow, bloated and the GNU license is an obstacle for commercial applications.
In addition, google chrome uses VP8/VP9, safari uses h264, and most of the time, it is necessary to encode the video in two formats, but not with this library.
All video files are encoded in an MP4 container with AAC audio that allows 100% compatibility with safari, mozila, chrome, android and iOS.

Works on ANDROID and IOS.

### How to use
```dart
VideoCompress videoCompress = VideoCompress();
```

**Get thumbnail from video path**
```dart
final uint8list = await videoCompress.getThumbnail(
  file.path,
  quality: 50, // default(100)
  position: -1 // default(-1)
);
```

**Get thumbnail file from video path**
```dart
final thumbnailFile = await videoCompress.getThumbnailWithFile(
  file.path,
  quality: 50, // default(100)
  position: -1 // default(-1)
);
```

**Get media information**

```dart
final info = await videoCompress.getMediaInfo(file.path);

```

**Compression Video**
> Compatible with IOS, Android and Web after compression.

```dart
final info = await videoCompress.compressVideo(
  file.path,
  quality: VideoQuality.DefaultQuality, // default(VideoQuality.DefaultQuality)
  deleteOrigin: false, // default(false)
);
```

**Check Compressing state**
```dart
videoCompress.isCompressing
```

**Stop compression**
> Will print InterruptedException in android, but not affect to use.

```dart
await videoCompress.cancelCompression()
```

**delete all cache files**
> Delete all files generated by this will delete all files located at 'video_compress', you shoule ought to know what are you doing.

```dart
await videoCompress.deleteAllCache()
```

**Subscribe the compression progress steam**
```dart
class ... extends State<MyApp> {
  Subscription _subscription;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _subscription =
        videoCompress.compressProgress$.subscribe((progress) {
      debugPrint('progress: $progress');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _subscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

- Add the trim function
